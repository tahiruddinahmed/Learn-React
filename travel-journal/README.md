# Create a travel-journal web app using React 

## create Header component 
 - Create a "components" folder and a Header component.
   Render the Header inside the App component.
 - Follow the Travel Journal design to build the Header
   for our page.

## Create the main layout 

 Challenge: Build out the Entry component and render 1 instance of it
 to the App
 
 For now, just hard-code in the data, which you can find in
 japan.md so you don't have to type it all out manually 
 
 Notes:
 – Only render 1 instance of this Entry component for now
 – I've pulled in marker.png for the little map marker icon
   that goes next to the location name
 – The main purpose of this challenge is to show you where our limitations*   currently are, so don't worry about the fact that you're hard-coding all
   this data into the component.

## Passing Props in the Entry component 
 Challenge: pass props to the Entry component to display
 its data. See the `data.md` file for each prop name and its
 value.
 
 Then on the Entry component, receive and display the values
 for those props. In the end, the page should look the same
 as it does now, but without all the hard-coded data in the
 component
 

## Map Entry component 

 Challenge:
  - import the array of data from data.js
  - map over the array to create an `<Entry />` component
    for every item in the data array.
  - display the array of Entry components in place of the current
    hard-coded `<Entry />` instance.
